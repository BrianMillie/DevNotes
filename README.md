# DevNotes

## Description
I had a need to store my front end developer notes somewhere where i could sort what i wanted to review.
I had a notepad thrown away and OneNote was ending up with a million tabs so this app places the notes in lessons and sub catagories
Easy to add, ammend and delete its ideal for Bootcamp and with some enhancement could be ideal for any learning notes
